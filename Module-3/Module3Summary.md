** Module 3 Summary **

** Stateless VS Stateful **
1. Most of the time functions are stateless, and objects are stateful. Here stateful means it can hold data value for further operation.

** v-3 **
Stack- Last in - First out (LIFO)
Stack is mainly done by array and linked list, and most of the time, array is done for being efficient, only when about queue in data structures, that time we will convert to linked list.

** v-4 **
Queue- First in - First Out (FIFO)
Queue is mainly done by linked list instead of array for efficiency. Queue use enqueue, dequeue same as push and pop consecutively, but in first order. Here, peek also works, but it will return the first one.
** v-5 **
linked list - initial one doesn't have previous linked connection
linked list connected to each other
last one doesn't have after linked connection.

** v-6 **
singly linked list - one way -initial part called head and last part called tail

doubly linked list - two way

circular linked list -- can connect head and tail.
